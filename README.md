Drupal Demo Framework / DF
=========
You should install http://drupal.org/project/df like described on https://drupal.org/node/2012876. But since that didn't worked for me and went crazy on the ruby gem and versions and dependencies i created a couple of simple shell scripts.

Installing a LAMP server and drupal site isn't that hard and i believe you shouldn't have to install a shitload of ruby.

Just make sure you have vagrant and virtualbox installed and try ./go.sh
