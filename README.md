Drupal Demo Framework / DF
=========
You should install http://drupal.org/project/df as described on https://drupal.org/node/2012876.
But since that didn't worked for me and I went crazy on the ruby gems, chef and versions dependencies
I created a couple of simple shell scripts.

Installing a LAMP server and Drupal site isn't that hard and I believe you shouldn't have to install a shitload of ruby.

Just make sure you have Vagrant and Virtualbox installed and try ./go.sh
